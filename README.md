# Gigapoly---Simplified-Console-Monopoly-Game
 Gigapoly is a simplified console version of the classic Monopoly board game, created for two human players sharing a single computer (hot-seat mode). Instead of buying cities, players purchase computer components, aiming to build a full computer or bankrupt their opponent.  The game is text-based and fully playable in the terminal.

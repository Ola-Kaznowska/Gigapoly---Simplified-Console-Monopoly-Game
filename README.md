# Gigapoly Simplified-Console-Monopoly-Game
 Gigapoly is a simplified console version of the classic Monopoly board game, created for two human players sharing a single computer (hot-seat mode). Instead of buying cities, players purchase computer components, aiming to build a full computer or bankrupt their opponent.  The game is text-based and fully playable in the terminal.


# 🎮 How to Play

Objective

Be the last player with money, or

Collect at least one component from each of the 5 categories to build a complete computer.


# Setup

# Two players enter their names.

# Both start with equal money ($1500) and begin on the "Start" field.

# Gameplay

# 1: Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.

# 2: Move your pawn by the number rolled.

# 3: Land on a field and perform the associated action:

 Component Fields: Buy if unowned, or pay rent if owned by the opponent.

Chance: Get a random positive effect (like bonus money or extra moves).

Risk: Random event that may be positive, neutral, or negative (e.g., lose a property).

Neostrada: Choose a tile to teleport to.

Start: Passing this field gives you $200.

# 4: Game continues until one player meets a win condition.
